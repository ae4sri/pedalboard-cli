# pedalboard-cli
A simple command line interface to easily manipulate audio files using Spotify's pedalboard library.

To run, simply download and run python .\app.py in the repository. Make sure to add the audio file you want to manipulate in the same directory,
and enter the full name of the file (e.g. enter "audio.mp3") when prompted.
